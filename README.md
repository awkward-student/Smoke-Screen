Smoke Screen, an extraordinary coding platform that takes you out of your coding comfort zone.

Engage in a unique challenge that sharpens your problem-solving skills and encourages creative thinking.

This project is designed for an event at National Institute of Technology, Trichy, and to provide a fresh perspective on coding. By removing the visual aspect and relying solely on your code logic, Smoke Screen helps you explore the depths of your coding expertise and adaptability.
